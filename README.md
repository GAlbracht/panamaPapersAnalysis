The goal of our project is to enhance data processing and analytics capabilities, especially in handling large-scale datasets. We aim to develop a scalable architecture that efficiently manages data ingestion, querying, and analysis, providing insights from complex data sets. The importance of this project lies in its ability to handle growing data volumes and complexities, a critical need in today's data-driven world. On a smaller scale, our problem focuses on the analysis of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) Offshore Leaks Database, which specifically addresses the United States' involvement in the Panama Papers. The Panama Papers consist of a large database of leaked documents that exposed a global network of offshore companies used for tax evasion, fraud, and other illegal activities.  

The majority of this problem set is to transform the Panama Papers into a structured network of entities, including persons, companies, and their interrelationships, all anchored in specific timeframes. This network is managed using Neo4j, a graph database that organizes data into nodes (representing entities such as individuals and companies, along with intermediaries and officers) and relationships (the connections between these nodes). 

Gaining insight into the Panama Papers is pivotal for this project as it represents an example of handling complex, large-scale datasets to uncover significant real-world problems. The Panama Papers, a massive collection of leaked documents, revealed global patterns of financial secrecy and corruption. Analyzing a dataset like this one demands robust data processing and analytics capabilities. This project's focus on scalable data management and efficient analysis directly aligns with the challenges posed by the Panama Papers, emphasizing the importance of advanced data processing tools in revealing critical insights from in-depth datasets. 

One of the important things relating to the Panama Papers is the use of tax haven countries to pay less taxes on assets. Tax haven countries are countries that have lower taxes relating to investments such as capital gains taxes and income taxes. These countries attract wealthy foreign investors who want to pay less in taxes (Investopedia). We wanted to know which tax haven countries were most popular with wealthy U.S. investors in the Panama Papers.
